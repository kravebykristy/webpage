        <p>I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, having worked in the construction industry with a consultancy who are specialists in Building Services. I then made the transition into the UX/UI digital design space with an emphasis on digital twins for the built environment as a step towards a creative design career, embellished with technical and process driven thinking.
          <br><br>My current role draws from my previous experiences in team management, systems thinking and user experience design to deliver large scale communities embedded with a sense of belonging through the built environment coupled with driving community initiatives and platforms for connection and expression.
          <br><br>Aside from work, I love cake making, the smell of fresh bread out of the oven and crafting with precious stones and metals.</p>
